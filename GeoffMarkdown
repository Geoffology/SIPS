# Title: The Bachelor Nick Viall 2017 Season 21 Sneak Preview


## Genre: Dating game show

## Performance:
- **Acting**: Every person in the video is acting. I do not believe the love is real, but they are conveying love in hopes of winning the show.
- **Cast**: In the Bachelor, there is one dude and like 20 chicks. There is also a host to the show that keeps the members on track.

## Production:
- **Soundtrack**: There is some intro music to the show and when the video wraps up, there is closing music.
- **Sound FX**: whenever anything dramatic happens, a piercing sound is played to emphasize the effects.
- **Shot length**: Many of the shots are quick to keep the attention of those who watch the show. Other than interviews, most shots only last a few seconds tops.
- **Shot focus**: Anything sexy is the focus. In the episode the title focuses on, any time a nipple slips out, the camera zooms in on the persons face.
- **Found/new footage**: There is little to no focus on new or creative footage. The video is to conveying clear imagery but focuses on emotions. Any new footage is made up to cause drama between members of the show. For starters, Rachel sleeps with Nick and Jennifer freaks out, the show makes up footage to exemplify this narrative.

## Story:
- **Plot**: there is an inherent lack of plot. The focus is to win the male over using sex appeal and emotion. In this episode a girl loses her top not once but twice, and this takes up a majority of the middle of the episode. 
- **Point of view**: The perspective is an out of frame view. The audience sees both the male and female view and the holistic overview.
- **Narrative arc**: Any narration is to clarify an action in the show. Most things are implied instead of explicitly stated.
