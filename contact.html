															<h2>Holistic Progress</h2>
															</header>
															<p>Hello, my name is Geoffrey Israel. I am a junior at Virginia Tech studying Chemistry with minors in Science Engineering Law and Technical Writing. When I started taking this class, my experience in digital writing was minimal, as this was the first class I have taken on the subject. At the completion of this course, I hoped for a deeper understanding of how website work and interact with their environments. This proved to be true and I could not be happier!</p>
															<p>This is a website I designed with the information gained from this class. What started as a simple template blossomed into a fantastic website utilized by many members of our community. I have successfully combined the V and T in the VT shapped student to produce something technology driven with a community focus.</p>
															<p>For my reflection, I would like to address what I found most interesting regarding web design; the new and exciting world it allowed me to explore. With this task being my first hands on experience relating to web design, it was cool to sink my teeth into this task and see what I could create. With help from my professor, I found a new love for HTML, and a deeper appreciation for the internet. While I enjoy being a user of online content, I am equally excited to produce some great websites down the road for different student organizations, professional tasks, and for fun. I also enjoyed learning and growing with my fellow students. When I had an issue I could not solve, I could turn to the student sitting next to me for help, and vice versa. This made both the struggle and the success worth more in the end, as having someone to share both aspects created a great team environment.</p>
															<p>To answer the question: "what did you find most challenging about composing in HTML", we must step back and look at the bigger picture. For someone with no experience building a website, learning the syntax took a little bit to comprehend. With that under my belt, the challenging part was learning how to properly synchronize Git Hub with Atom and my projects. There are so many small intricacies that I cannot seem to grasp the first time I work at them. Take for example integrating a picture. A simple change in Goat.jpg and goat.jpg is enough to render my work useless. Complimenting this, I am trying to work with a program that I have limited knowledge about and must read between the fine lines to make sure I am removing the proper material. While there is a lot I do not know, I enjoy the challenge of problem solving and working to make my code display properly.</p>
															<p>My notion of digital writing has changed drastically over the course of Unit 1. For starters, I believed digital writing referred to the act of reading information online, not composing it in an interesting and readable way. Before this course, I thought posting a comment to Facebook constituted digital writing. As we delve into the intricacies of HTML and CSS, it is clear that there is a lot more going on behind the scenes. From the introduction class which explained what Git Hub and Atom are to current day synthesis of website creation, my notion of digital writing has expanded to include a lot more of the technical aspects. Integrating the VT student showed me the importance of understanding digital writing and how this skill translates into more than one facet of my life. While a digital writer can simply state the information they want to convey, it is more powerful to utilize the HTML and CSS syntax to get your point across. That in itself is an exemplification of the VT shaped student and what tasks they will be able to complete after obtaining a holistic education from Virginia Tech.</p>
